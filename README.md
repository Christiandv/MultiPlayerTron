 The server keeps track of all game logic. The clients meerly output what the server gives them and tells the server when someone turns. This way everyone's view of the gamestate should be consistant and people cannot spoof where they are in the game, which is generally good. 

 You need Node.js to be able to set up the server. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

 Run "node server.js" to start up the server. Currently clients connect through localhost:5000  

 You will also need Express.js to run the project. Their website is : expressjs.com
